        <h1>Abundant Privacy</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>We're Abundant Science, and this is our plain-language Abundant Privacy manifesto. We are a proudly Canadian
            company (Toronto-based) operating under the laws of Canada and Ontario. We do not sell, broker, or share
            data you provide us. We respect your body and your health, which means that we take security and privacy
            seriously by design. Abundant Science is building rapid testing as a category in Canada and worldwide. Any
            and all actions we take with data you provide us serve that purpose. Your data are protected by Canadian and
            Ontarian law, and by the choices we have made to prevent future catastrophe.</p>

        <p>We've studied Canada's healthcare privacy failures so you don't have to relive them. In 2019,
            LifeLabs—Canada's largest lab testing company—opened 15 million Canadians' health data to hackers for nearly
            a year before they noticed. That's 1 in 2.5 Canadians nationwide, but it's worse: LifeLabs primarily
            operates in Ontario, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan, with a combined population of 20.8 million in 2019.
            This means the breach affected over 70% of residents in these provinces—nearly 3 out of 4 people. They had
            just 4 security staff for 5,700 employees, no written security policies, and stored passwords in plaintext.
            That's not us. We build security in from day one, not after a harmful breach.</p>
